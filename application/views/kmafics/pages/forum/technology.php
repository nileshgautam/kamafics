                                    </div>

                                        <b>Virtual Reality is the future. </b>
                                        <p>It is something which is widely accepted by the masses, however, the underlying reality remains that the future seems far away. Despite repeated advancements in technology, virtual reality has just barely crossed the functional threshold in terms of practicality, usage and utility.</p>

                                        <p>Augmented Reality, on the other hand, is the present. It already exists, and it’s being incorporated within various fields with great success. The best example of this is the game Pokemon Go. It was a worldwide phenomenon that brought people out of their houses and relive their childhood memories and the root of it was its augmented reality function.</p>

                                        <p>Looking at the future of Augmented Reality, technological giants such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Samsung et cetera have deployed a major chunk of their resources for research, development and implementation of AR, hence, banking on its success.</p>

                                        <p>But for the average individual, Augmented Reality seems to be more of a fad than the future. It appears to be seasonal in nature with a constant trend of peak and trough.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>This is accentuated by the usage of augmented reality for the average individual. They are limited to using filters on social media applications such as Instagram, Snapchat et cetera and envision to transform their environment according to their preferences.</p>



                                        <blockquote>
                                            <i class="fa fa-quote-left font-20"></i>
                                            <p>But is this true?.</p>

                                        </blockquote>
                                        <div class="wt-post-media wt-img-effect zoom-slow">
                                            <a href="javascript:;"><img src="<?php echo base_url('assets/images/blog/default/t2.jpg') ?>" alt=""></a>

                                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Is Augmented Reality limited?</h3>
                                        <p>The answer is NO. It is only limited to our imaginations, as has been portrayed by several companies incorporating it within their operations.</p>
                                        <p>We’ve mentioned the example of Pokemon GO and apps such as Instagram and Snapchat, however, that is just the tip of the iceberg for Augmented Reality’s applications.</p>
                                        <p>It can be implemented for educational training, interactive classrooms and offices, immersive travel experiences, viewing how furniture looks within homes without actually buying it (IKEA), shopping for clothes (UNIQLO), etc.</p>
                                        <p>All this reinforces our point that AR is limited only by our imagination and the constraints of technology that existed are slowly being freed as the technology advances.</p>

                                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Is Augmented Reality available to all?</h3>
                                        <p>It is to a certain extent. More and more smartphones, a device that most of us use, have augmented reality features installed onto it.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, due to research and development, the market is not limited to smartphones and is leading to further inventions which utilizes augmented reality as their base—such as the HoloLens from Microsoft, Google Smart Glasses et cetera.</p>
                                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold">How is Augmented Reality Useful for Businesses?</h3>
                                        <p>Businesses can immerse the customer into a simulation, which shows them exactly what would happen should they purchase the products on sale. This is an irresistible lure for the consumer since he/she can verify whether they want the product, and once their mind is made up, it’s effortless to make the sale.</p>
                                        <p>Businesses can also use Augmented Reality to spread their company values and other messages to the customers. The ease of doing so has dramatically increased with the proliferation of augmented reality capable devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, et cetera.</p>
                                        <p>The market is portrays Augmented Reality as the next big thing with the market valuation at $ 4.3 billion in 2019 and projected at an 86 per cent growth to $ 8 billion in 2020.
                                        </p>
